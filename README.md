> ### About this repository
>
> **This is not our API.** This repository is an independent, third-party profile of a company's
> **publicly available** API surface, maintained by [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com).
> API Evangelist does not operate, host, resell, or support this company's APIs, and is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by the company unless stated on the profile.
>
> **Where the information came from.** Everything here is assembled from material a member of the
> public can reach with a browser and no credentials — the company's own website, developer portal
> and documentation, the specifications it publishes for public use (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema,
> `apis.json`, `llms.txt` and similar), its public repositories, and its public status, pricing and
> changelog pages. **Nothing here is obtained by breaching a system, defeating an access control, or
> using credentials of any kind.**
>
> **The rating is an independent assessment.** The Kin Score and Agent Readiness rating are
> independently calculated scores of a company's *public* API artifacts, produced by API Evangelist
> against a published rubric. They are not certifications, endorsements, security assessments, or
> audits, and they score published artifacts — not the quality, safety, or security of the software.
>
> **Corrections, re-scores, and removal are free.** No partnership, contract, or purchase is
> required, and you do not need to justify the request.
>
> - **Something wrong?** Open an issue on this repository, or email

> - **Published something new?** Ask for a re-score and we will re-run the rating.
> - **Want the listing taken down?** Say so and we will honor it. The profile is reduced to your
>   company name, a factual description, and a link to your own site, and the company is recorded as
>   **unrated** — never scored zero for having asked.
>
> **Response times.** Acknowledgement within **one business day**; removal or restriction within
> **two business days**; corrections and re-scores within **five business days**.
>
> **On a security or compliance team?** Email
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) with *security* in the subject line and
> you will get a person, not a form. We will tell you exactly which public URLs this profile was
> built from so your team can see the same surface we did, and we will take the listing down on
> request while you work through it.

Rowy is an open-source low-code backend platform that puts an Airtable-like spreadsheet UI on top of Google Cloud Firestore, with JavaScript/TypeScript Cloud Functions, column automations, and webhooks. It is primarily a UI plus a Firebase/GCP framework deployed into the user's own project; its main inbound API surface is per-table webhooks running on Cloud Run, alongside Rowy Run backend services and the underlying Firestore data store accessed via the Firebase SDK.

## APIs

### Rowy Webhooks

Rowy's primary inbound API surface. Each table can generate an HTTPS webhook endpoint running on Google Cloud Run (the rowy-hooks service) that receives POST requests from external systems. Built-in types include Basic, Typeform, Sendgrid, and Github; a low-code parser function maps the incoming request into a new row, with optional condition and verification functions.

### Rowy Run / Cloud Functions

Rowy Run is a group of Google Cloud Run services (rowy-backend and rowy-hooks) deployed into the user's own GCP project that powers derivatives, action scripts, webhooks, user management, and one-click Cloud Function deployment. Service URLs are generated at deploy time and stored in Firestore (_rowy_/settings); there is no fixed public REST base URL or documented endpoint catalog.

### Rowy Firestore Data

Rowy tables map directly onto Google Cloud Firestore collections. Programmatic data access is not a Rowy-specific REST API; it is the underlying Firestore data store reached via the Firebase/Google Cloud SDKs and the Firestore REST/RPC API. Rowy provides the spreadsheet UI and low-code layer on top of this data.
